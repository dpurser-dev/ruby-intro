# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb
# puts "Hell World"
puts 7
puts 5 + 2
quantity = 3 + 3 + 3
food = "tacos"
puts "#{quantity}" "#{food}"
# How does the syntax work here? Does {} mean evaluate the variable, rather than the word?

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers

# Perform simple math with numbers

# Strings

# Combine strings together

# Variables

# Combine strings and variables

# String manipulation
